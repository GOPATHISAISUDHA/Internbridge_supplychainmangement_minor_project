NAME OF THE PROJECT: Implementing Sustainable Supply Chain Practices at Nestl√©.

I focus on the Green Supply Chain Revolution. The goal is to make a company's supply chain more sustainable.

Here are some of the tasks I did :
 * Research sustainable practices for different supply chain stages (e.g., using recycled materials, reducing packaging waste, optimizing transportation routes).
 * Develop a plan to implement these practices within a specific company or product line.
 * Calculate the potential environmental and cost benefits of these changes.

 I collected secondary data through different websites and publications.
 I converted that to primary data
